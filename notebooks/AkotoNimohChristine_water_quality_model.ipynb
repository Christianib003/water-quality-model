    "**Assignment**: Building a Classification Model Using Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "Develop a neural network-based classification model using a provided dataset, incorporating multiple optimization techniques and ensuring equitable group contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, we will take the cleaned and imputed dataset and use it to train, test, and evaluate a deep learning model**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The key steps we'll cover are:\n",
    "1. Loading the preprocessed (imputed) dataset.\n",
    "2. Separating features and the target variable.\n",
    "3. Splitting the dataset into three distinct portions: training, validation, and testing sets. This is crucial for robust model development and evaluation.\n",
    "4. Applying feature scaling (StandardScaler) correctly after the split to prevent data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The data cleaning and imputation steps were performed in a previous notebook. \n",
    "If you'd like to review that process, please refer to: [Data Preprocessing Notebook](data_preprocessing.ipynb).\n",
